# 🌌 **Welcome to the GitHub Black Hole** 🌌

Abandon all logic, ye who enter here! This repo defies the laws of coding and common sense.

### 🔧 Languages We Speak (incoherently):

- **Python** 🐍: Where the indentation decides the fate of the universe.
- **JavaScript** 💥: Because why should anything behave consistently?
- **Bash** 🖥️: It works on my machine… maybe.

### 🌀 Features You Didn’t Ask For:

```python
def infinite_confusion():
    while True:
        print("What is happening?!")
```

Brace yourself for the **chaos**!
